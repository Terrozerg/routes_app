    <string name="large_text">In this blog, we learned how to use Coordinator Layout in our application.
        Coordinator Layout is used to manage the transactions and animation of various views present in an Activity.
        Before Coordinator Layout, Frame Layout was used, but using more than one views in Frame Layout results in overlapping of views over one another.
        At the end of the blog, we did some examples to have a clear understanding. Hope you enjoyed the blog.</string>
